    <p>Other diamond shapes that may interest you include cushion-cut loose diamonds, round-cut loose diamonds, emerald-cut loose diamonds, and even asscher-cut loose diamonds.  Each of these cuts brings something unique and stunning to the table. For instance, the emerald-cut diamond will reflect light in a subdued way, much less brilliant than a round-cut diamond.  This may be more to your taste, and you may be drawn toward the long, smooth surface of the emerald-cut diamond.</p>
<div class="flop">Aside from the cut, you should also consider how large you want your diamond to be, and what color range you are aiming for. Orlando Jewelers has sizes, colors, and clarity to fit every budget.  You may also find Orlando round-cut diamonds with slight inclusions which would be invisible to the naked eye, for a price that is more within your budget.
